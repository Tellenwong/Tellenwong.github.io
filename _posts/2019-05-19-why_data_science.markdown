Why did I decide to pursue a career in data science? Well, all the talk about [Harvard Business Review naming data science as the “sexiest job of the 21st century”](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century) certainly didn’t hurt. However, it took a bit more than this allure to make me consider dipping my toes into such an intellectually challenging field. 

I want to share some of the drivers that convinced me to enroll in Flatiron’s data science bootcamp, just one of the first few stops on my sure-to-be long, winding data science educational path.

1. *I seem to be heading down the data science path anyway!*

As a research technician for a Department of Energy atmospheric research project, I have been working with data rather peripherally for some time. By working with data, I mean both searching for it and aiding in the creation of it.

A regular part of my work day involves quality checking data files and plots from atmospheric instrumentation located on 2 Arctic climate research sites. This instrumentation includes radars, lidars, temperature/humidity sensors, wind anemometers, and more -- even high-quality precipitation cameras! 

I have produced my own publicly distributed data files as well. I have been tasked with setting up[ data loggers ](http://https://www.campbellsci.com/) and associated logger programs to collect meteorological data that are regularly output to data tables. These data tables are both distributed to users upon request, as well as plotted on a website for users to get a glimpse of the local weather. 

I mention my experience producing data tables for this reason: I have seen how data can be produced in a manner that is difficult for end users to understand, as I have inadvertently created confusing data myself. One example includes meteorological data in which the timestamps were all offset by 1 hour from what I had expected. [Using the Pandas library](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.tseries.offsets.DateOffset.html), I was able to correct the timestamps and still make the files publicly available.

These mistakes have encouraged me to look at data with careful eyes. I don't take these insights for granted now; I know that mistaken timestamps, missing data and headers, and unrealistic values are possible in any data set. 

2. *I enjoy the hunt for data.*
While much of data science work may seem mundane to outsiders, I feel that there are exciting challenges inherent in each step of the data science process. For example, even the initial gathering or scraping of data is not always an easy task.

For many of my work projects, such as gathering data for the production of scientific papers, I have been lucky to have access to a number of user-friendly meteorological databases. These databases have allowed me to access a wide swath of reliable measurements within minutes of a request. 

However, data are more often unstructured and widely-distributed, both online and offline, and data scientists are needed to wrangle this data. It is an exciting thought that data scientists could gain valuable insight into a wide variety of fields from learning on the job, and are tasked with making educated conclusions and recommendations for questions that have been heretofore weakly examined.

Heck, even when databases are easy to access, there is still the added challenge of ensuring that you are gathering the right data for your particular question.

3. *I can answer my own questions!*

As I dive deeper into learning languages such as Python and SQL that allow me to easily organize and prepare data for informative visualizations, I wonder what other questions I can answer for myself using available data and careful analysis.

As an avid writer, I most enjoy the process of communicating insights after the work of data capturing, cleaning, processing, and analysis. In my search for the qualities requisite for data scientists, I was pleasantly surprised to read over and over again that [good storytelling is an integral part of the data science process](https://towardsdatascience.com/storytelling-for-data-scientists-317c2723aa31).

4. *There will always be more to learn.*

My interests in particular careers have varied since my youth, but my drive to keep learning has never waned. Data science and the available workflows are constantly evolving, especially as unthinkably large data sets become more of the norm.

A bootcamp is just a first step, and on-the-job experience is the next one.
